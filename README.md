# Conference-Notify


Conference-Notify will be an open source web based application that will aggregate conference information from wikicfp , guide2research and other such websites to create a single point of aggregated information and build index over the same. These information can then be searched by users through plain text queries. On finding relevant conferences the user can create recurring notifiers for themselves for the date reminders which can be enabled on both mobile devices and through browser notification.
